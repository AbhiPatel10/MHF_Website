We conduct regular free health check-up camps, CPR and Basic Life Support (BLS) training, and medical awareness seminars in both urban and rural areas. With the support of reputed hospitals, doctors, and health organizations, we aim to ensure that no one is deprived of basic health care. These camps provide free diagnosis, consultations, and guidance on preventive health practices. <br /> <br /> Through our sessions, villagers and citizens learn the importance of early detection and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Our CPR and BLS workshops empower individuals with life-saving techniques during emergencies. We also distribute health kits and encourage people to undergo regular checkups. The initiative bridges the gap between healthcare professionals and rural populations. Mission Health continues to expand its reach every year, touching more lives and spreading the message that “Health is the greatest wealth.”</p>',

Our volunteers regularly visit these libraries to guide students and promote reading habits. We also organize reading sessions, storytelling days, and academic support workshops. This initiative bridges the educational divide between rural and urban areas, helping students dream bigger and achieve more. Each library we set up is not just a collection of books — it’s a doorway to opportunity. Har Gaav Library reflects our commitment to building an educated, aware, and empowered generation.</p>',
