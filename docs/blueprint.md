## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, natural green (#8FBC8F) to represent growth and harmony.  This hue aims to capture the 'hope' concept by avoiding more tired stylistic choices, while retaining an organic feeling.
- Background color:  A light, desaturated green (#F0F8F0) maintains a connection to the primary, and serves as a serene backdrop that lets the other design elements take center stage.  The desaturation prevents the screen from tiring the eye.
- Accent color: A desaturated cyan (#77B5FE), standing slightly apart from the green hues to provide distinctiveness in CTAs and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif suitable for headlines or body text.
- Simple vector icons with moderately rounded corners to maintain a friendly aesthetic.
- Clean, intuitive, fully responsive, mobile-first layout emphasizing clarity and whitespace.
- Subtle fade-in entrance animations, gentle scaling/upward motions on cards, and simple button feedback.
